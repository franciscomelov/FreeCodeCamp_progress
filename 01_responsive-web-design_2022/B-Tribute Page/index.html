        <h2>What´s GNU</h2>
        <p>
        The GNU operating system is a complete free software system, upward-compatible with Unix. GNU stands for
        “GNU's
        Not Unix.” It is pronounced as one syllable with a hard g. Richard Stallman made the Initial
        Announcement of the
        GNU Project in September 1983. A longer version called the GNU Manifesto was published in March 1985. It
        has
        been translated into several other languages.

        <h3>Why GNU</h3>
        <p>The primary and continuing goal of GNU is to offer a Unix-compatible system that would be 100% free
          software.
          Not 95% free, not 99.5%, but 100%. The name of the system, GNU, is a recursive acronym meaning GNU's
          Not
          Unix—a
          way of paying tribute to the technical ideas of Unix, while at the same time saying that GNU is
          something
          different. Technically, GNU is like Unix. But unlike Unix, GNU gives its users freedom.</p>

        <h3>Where GNU</h3>
        <p>If you're looking for a whole system to install, see our list of GNU/Linux distributions which are
          entirely free software.

          To look for individual free software packages, both GNU and non-GNU, please see the Free Software
          Directory: a categorized, searchable database of free software. The Directory is actively maintained
          by
          the Free Software Foundation and includes links to program home pages where available, as well as
          entries for all GNU packages. Another list of all GNU packages is below. Free software documentation
          links are listed separately.</p>

        <h3>How to GNU</h3>
        <p>The FSF maintains a list of high-priority free software projects; please help with these projects if
          you
          can.
          For other ways to contribute to GNU, including reviving unmaintained GNU packages and helping with
          development,
          see the GNU help wanted page.
          If you're writing a new program and would like to make your software an official GNU package, see
          the
          evaluation
          information and submission form. Refer to the ethical repository criteria for guidance choosing a
          hosting
          service for your project.
          If you're maintaining or developing a GNU package, whether newly dubbed or of long standing, this
          short
          list of
          tips for GNU maintainers may be useful, along with this information about GNU software developer
          resources.</p>

        <h3>A GNU philosofy</h3>
        <p>
          Free software means that the software's users have freedom. (The issue is not about price.) We
          developed
          the GNU operating system so that users can have freedom in their computing.

          Specifically, free software means users have the four essential freedoms:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>to run the program</li>
          <li>to study and change the program in source code form</li>
          <li>to redistribute exact copies</li>
          <li>to distribute modified versions.</li>
        </ol>

        <p> Software differs from material objects—such as chairs, sandwiches, and gasoline—in that it can
          be copied
          and changed much more easily. These facilities are why software is useful; we believe a
          program's users
          should be free to take advantage of them, not solely its developer.</p>
